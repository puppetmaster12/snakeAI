<h2>A Snake game | PyGame and Deep Q Learning</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This project is part of my learning experience on machine learning and deep learning. The project is comprised of a regular snake game built with pygame. In addition an AI agent added using Deep Q Learning built using Pytorch. I wanted to learn how to use reinforcement learning in combination with a simple game like snake and improve on it to make it more robust in solving the snake game manouvering.</p>
